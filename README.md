#  Interview Preparation App

## Overview

The Interview Preparation App is a web application designed to help users and Project Engineers (PEs) prepare for interviews. The app utilizes GPT-3.5, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, to facilitate interview question and answer sessions. Users and PEs can engage in interview practice sessions where Chat GPT asks questions, and participants can choose to level up or down the complexity of the questions.

## Features

- Interactive Interview Practice: Users and PEs can engage in interview preparation sessions by answering questions posed by Chat GPT.
- Question Leveling: After each question, participants have the option to level up or level down the complexity of the questions based on their comfort and readiness.
- Real-time Chat: The chat interface allows for a natural and interactive conversation with Chat GPT.
- Frontend in ReactJS: The frontend of the application is built using ReactJS, offering a modern and responsive user interface.
- Backend in NodeJS: The backend of the application is developed in NodeJS, providing a robust and efficient server for handling requests and interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   
   git clone https://github.com/adi21shyam/InterviewPrep_ChatBot.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   cd InterviewPrep_ChatBot
   

3. Install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory to store environment variables:

   
   TOUCH .env
   

   Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

   
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   

   Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your OpenAI GPT-3 API key.

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:

   
   cd backend
   npm start
   

   The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. Start the frontend development server:

   
   cd frontend
   npm start
   

   The frontend development server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Chat GPT Interview Preparation App.

## Usage
